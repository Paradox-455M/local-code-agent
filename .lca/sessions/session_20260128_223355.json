      "response": "Based on the codebase structure, this project appears to be a **Local Code Agent** system that manages code development sessions with conversation tracking.\n\n## Main Purpose\nThe project provides a framework for managing code development sessions with conversation history tracking and code manipulation tools.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Core Components\n- **Agent System** (`agent/`): Contains three main components:\n  - `planner` - Likely handles code planning\n  - `executor` - Executes code operations\n  - `reviewer` - Reviews code changes\n\n### Tools\n- **Code Manipulation** (`tools/`): Provides utilities for:\n  - Applying code patches\n  - Generating diffs\n  - Reading files\n  - Git operations (status, diff)\n\n### Session Management\n- **Conversation Tracking** (`memory/conversation.py`): Manages session states and conversation history\n- **Testing** (`tests/`): Includes tests for session management functionality\n\n### Core Functionality\nThe system appears to track conversation sessions with:\n- Session management\n- Conversation state tracking\n- Turn-based conversation handling\n\nThis suggests it's designed to support code development workflows where conversations about code changes are tracked and managed across different development sessions.",
