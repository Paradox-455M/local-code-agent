# Deliberate Repo Context

- Decide whether repo context is needed before reading any files; state the decision briefly.
- If context is needed, start with high-signal files (e.g., `README.md`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, key configs).
- Expand scope only when the initial context is insufficient; explain why.
- Avoid scanning every API or test; use targeted search to find the most relevant files.
- Do not read `.lca/**` or session data unless explicitly requested.
- Keep improvement/impact responses to 2-5 bullets and note what was read.
